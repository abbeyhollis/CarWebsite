    <p>At this time, used cars are more expensive than ever. Therefore, there is
        a much bigger need for repairing cars. Yet, high schoolers are usually
        forgotten about for repairs. Our organization helps teens who do not have
        the funds or knowledge to fix their cars. We also like to showcase our cases to
        demonstrate the help we give to teens.</p>
